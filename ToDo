Some tests set a MIME and have subtests. For example
    # PKZIP multi-volume archive
    0	string		PK\x07\x08PK\x03\x04	Zip multi-volume archive data, at least PKZIP v2.50 to extract

At the moment we ignore the subtests and stop at the first MIME.

The rule strength hasn't been taken into account.
